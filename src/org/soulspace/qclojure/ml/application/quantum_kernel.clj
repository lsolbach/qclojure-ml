  "Production-ready quantum kernel methods for quantum machine learning.
  
  Quantum kernels compute similarity measures between classical data points by encoding
  them into quantum states and measuring their overlap. This implementation provides
  hardware-compatible kernel computation using measurement-based approaches suitable
  for real quantum devices.
  
  Key Features:
  - Hardware-compatible SWAP test circuits for overlap estimation
  - Support for multiple encoding strategies (angle, amplitude, basis, IQP)
  - Efficient kernel matrix computation using transients
  - Batched processing for large datasets
  - Integration with QClojure backend protocols
  - Production-ready error handling and validation
  
  Algorithm:
  1. Encode classical data points into quantum states using feature maps
  2. Compute pairwise overlaps |⟨ψ(x_i)|ψ(x_j)⟩|² using SWAP test circuits
  3. Build kernel matrix for use with classical ML algorithms
  4. Support symmetric and asymmetric kernel computations"

(defn swap-test-circuit
  "Create a SWAP test circuit to measure overlap between two quantum states.
  
  The SWAP test is a fundamental quantum algorithm for estimating the overlap
  |⟨ψ|φ⟩|² between two quantum states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩. It uses an ancilla qubit
  and controlled operations to encode the overlap in measurement statistics.
  
  Circuit structure:
  1. Prepare ancilla in |+⟩ state (Hadamard gate)
  2. Apply controlled-SWAP between the two state registers
  3. Apply Hadamard to ancilla
  4. Measure ancilla: P(0) = (1 + |⟨ψ|φ⟩|²)/2
  
  Parameters:
  - circuit: Base quantum circuit
  - register1-qubits: Qubit indices for first quantum state
  - register2-qubits: Qubit indices for second quantum state
  - ancilla-qubit: Ancilla qubit index for SWAP test

  ;; Example usage and testing

  ;; 1. Create sample data

  ;; 2. Configure quantum kernel
  (def kernel-config

     :num-qubits 2
     :shots 1024
     :encoding-options {:gate-type :ry}}))

;; 3. Test overlap computation between two points
;; (def overlap-result (quantum-kernel-overlap backend (first sample-data) (second sample-data) kernel-config))

;; 4. Compute full kernel matrix
;; (def kernel-matrix (quantum-kernel-matrix backend sample-data kernel-config))

;; 5. Analyze kernel matrix
;; (analyze-kernel-matrix kernel-matrix)

;; 6. Create kernel function for ML pipeline
;; (def kernel-fn (create-quantum-kernel backend kernel-config))
;; (kernel-fn [0.1 0.2] [0.8 0.9])

;; Expected properties:
;; - Kernel matrix should be symmetric
;; - Diagonal elements should be 1.0
;; - All values should be between 0.0 and 1.0
;; - Similar data points should have higher kernel values
